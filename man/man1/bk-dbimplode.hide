.SH NAME
bk dbimplode \- create database file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.Bc bk dbimplode [
.OPTreq \-d dir
]
.OPT \-q
.B "file[s] | -"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\*(BK provides database functionality via database records, also known 
as DB files.
Each file implements one row of a database table.
.LP
The
.B dbimplode
command implodes a set of fields into a db file.
Each field is a file whose name is the field name and whose contents
are the field contents.
By default, the record is imploded from a directory whose name is
based on the record name followed by "_db.bk_skip", i.e.,
.ARG filename_db.bk_skip/fieldname .
If the files being exploded are being specified on stdin, or if more than
one record is specified,
then only the default directory is supported.
.LP
Imploding a set of fields into a file removes the fields and subdirectory
containing those fields upon successful implosion.
.LP
Use
.B dbimplode
in conjunction with bk dbexplode, which explodes a record into fields.
.LP
See
.B bk help dbrecord
for a description of the database file format and operations.
