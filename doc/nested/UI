bk alias - manage aliases for lists of components
	bk alias add [-C] <name> <alias | component> ...
	bk alias [list] [-r<rev>] [-ehmk]<name>
	bk alias [list] [-r<rev>] [-hm]
	bk alias new [-C] <name> <alias | component> ...
	bk alias rm [-C] <name>
	bk alias rm [-C] <name> <alias | component> ...
	bk alias set [-C] <name> <alias | component> ...
	add -@<URL> -f -q options from populate.
	/*
	 * LM notes: I do not want to document these.  I feel they are
	 * internal interfaces, necessary because we implement modifications
	 * as "bk alias <verb> HERE ...", but there is no reason to expose
	 * these to users, it's just more churn.  The first time that we
	 * get a support issue based on this I will change bk alias to not
	 * allow any write operations in anything but a fully populated
	 * nested collection.
	 *
	 * If you see a flaw with that approach, now is the time to scream.
	 *
	 * Wayne notes: the backoff position on allowing 'bk alias' to
	 * populate repositories is to make aliases in or implied by
	 * HERE be read only.  I think when Larry says 'fully
	 * populated' he is just observing that 'bk here set all' will
	 * allow any alias to be edited, but this is overkill.

bk attach - attach a component repository to a product repository
	bk attach [-qlC] [-E<e>=<v>] [-r<rev>] <from> [<component>]
bk comps - list the components belonging to a product
        bk comps [-hkm]
	default: lists all components as paths (-k: keys)
	-h: list only those here
	-m: list only those present
	Description on -h needs to make it clear that -h is the list
	of *components* here, not the aliases you may have populated;
	use "bk here" to get that.
bk here - list or change the set of aliases/components are present
        bk here [list]
        bk here add <alias | component> [...]
        bk here rm <alias | component> [...]
        bk here set <alias | component> [...]
        bk here check
        bk here where [<alias | component>]
	Description needs to say that the default is listing what you
	populated here in the "names" you used to populate them.

	bk partition [-q] [-C<components>] [-G<gonelist>] <from> <to>
