Suppose that you have a tree which has open merge pointers (resolve
can give you this if it gets wacked in the middle of a resolve).

A) Run "bk csetmark -c" to see if there are any such pointers

B) Make the following tree

	RESYNC/BitKeeper/etc
	RESYNC/BitKeeper/tmp
	RESYNC/SCCS
   
C) Copy the s.ChangeSet file into RESYNC/SCCS

D) Copy the unmerged s.files into the appropriate place in the RESYNC tree

E) Run "bk sccstool" on each of the files and find the left/gca/right
   and put a r.file next to the s.file in the RESYNC tree.  The
   r.file should look like

   merge deltas 1.4 1.2 1.2.1.3 lm 99/08/05 12:43:12

   assuming that 1.4/1.2/1.2.1.3 are left/gca/right

You have now reproduced what a resync would have done.  Run resolve.
Before running resolve, you might back up the repository in case you
forgot something and want to go add it.
