WinCtl.exe is a free small command line utility which provides simple
control of windows. From the command line, you can minimize, maximize,
restore, raise, lower, hide, show, resize and reposition windows.  You
can specify which window by its windowid, name (title) or class.

Usage: WinCtl  [-focus | -id windowid | -title title | -name name | -class class] [command...]
       WinCtlW [-focus | -id windowid | -title title | -name name | -class class] [command...]

WinCtl performs a window control operation on a top level window.
Each command (alii in parentheses) is one of:
    show (unhide)
    restore (deiconify)
    hide
    maximize
    minimize (iconify)
    normal
    top (raise)
    topmost
    notopmost
    bottom (lower)
    pos x-pos y-pos (move x-pos y-pos)
    size width heigh

command defaults to "restore". Commands are case insensitive.

Specify a window by either a numeric decimal window id (-id windowid)
or its case insensitive title/name (-title title or -name name) or its
case insensitive class (-class class) or the current foreground window (-focus).
When a class is specified, commands apply only to the first window of that class.
Switches may be abbreviated.

For example:
        WinCtl -class Emacs restore raise pos 0 0 size 1000 700

WinCtl is free - you may use and distribute WinCtl without charge
but this README file and notice must be distributed with WinCtl.

WinCtlW.exe behaves like WinCtl.exe except that it is
not a console app. Thus, WinCtlW is suitable for use
in Windows shortcuts; it will run without opening
a console window.
