  - Fixed argument parsing for '-q' and '-mime' options (these used
    to only work if they were the last argument)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Blat version 1.5 has just been released. This version has the following
enhancements:

 - Two bugs were corrected that made Blat generate exceptions with
   certain CC or BCC adresses.
 - Blat now generates descriptive error messages, rather than the
   infamous "gensock error 4017" type errors
 - Blat now returns an error code when the SMTP session fails
 - A new option -mime was added. This implements the possibility to
   use the MIME quoted-printable transfer encoding. The assumptions
   are:
        1: The file is a text file
        2: The charset is ISO 8859/1

The archive zip file (Intel: Blat15.zip, DEC Alpha: Blat15a.zip) can
be obtained from the usual places (although both SimTel and CICA will
take some time to move the package to the right place). To select the
ftp site near you please use the Blat WWW home page at:
