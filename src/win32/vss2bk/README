This is a Visual SourceSafe to BitKeeper converter. This program uses
the VSS command line interface "ss.exe" to extract data from VSS,
and uses BitKeeper's "bk.exe" * interface to import data into BitKeeper
It uses only three "ss" sub-commands:
1) ss dir proj -R
2) ss histry
3) ss get
You may need to set SSDIR to point ss.exe to the vss database.

Note: This proggram does only one thing: it converts a VSS delta to
a BitKeeper delta.
It does not commit the deltas nor detect changeset boundaries.

To compile this program, you need
a) The cygwin "make" command
b) mingw gcc compiler
c) To compile:
	i)   cd to vss2bk/src
	ii)  bk -r get 
	iii) make
