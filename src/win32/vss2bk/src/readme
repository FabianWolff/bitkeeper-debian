This is a Visual SourceSafe to BitKeeper converter. This program uses
the VSS command line interface "ss.exe" to extract data from VSS,
and uses BitKeeper's "bk.exe" * interface to import data into BitKeeper
It uses only three "ss" sub-commands:
1) ss dir proj -R
2) ss histry
3) ss get
You may need to set SSDIR to point ss.exe to the vss database

Note: This proggram do only one thing, it convert VSS delta to BitKeeper
delta. It does not commit the delta and it does not detect changeset
boundary; the advance feature is provided by the "bk findcset" command.
The command is avaliable in a BitKeeper internal release, contact
support@bitmover when your VSS DB is converted and is ready
for "bk findcset".

To compile this program, you need
a) The cygwin "make" command
b) mingw gcc compiler
c) To compile:
	i)   cd to vss2bk/src
	ii)  bk -r get 
	iii) make
