Running tests:

Open a cygwin/msys window and type:

    ./doit i.*

The test script will pop up explorer window(s) as necessary and guide you
through the interactive tests.  The test area is cleaned up after each
i. script is run so the order isn't strictly important.


Separate work proceeds on fully automatic tests.
