This is an installation tool.  It needs two arguments to run, an
executable program and a data file.  It generates a program which
will unpack the two files and run the first giving it the full path
to each file as arguments.

If the installer is called with any arguments, then first program will
be passed those arguments.

Suppose that you had installer.sh and tarball.gz and you packed those
into installer.bin.  Then it works like this:

    $ installer.bin -> installer.sh installer.sh tarball.gz
    $ installer.bin --doit -> installer.sh --doit installer.sh tarball.gz
