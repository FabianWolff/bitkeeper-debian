* CFLAGS should be passed down from above.  The GNU stuff wants to compile
  with -g -O2 (usually), we want no debugging in production builds.
* Installed binaries should be stripped.  (General problem with install.)
* diff has been hacked to use the POSIX.1 regexp routines from libc.  Are
  these widespread enough that we don't need our own copy?  (If we do, use
  Harry Spencer's, not FSF's; it's about 4x smaller.)
* make; make install will delete gnu/bin and recreate it on the second pass.
  This is bad, because if you do make install as root, root now owns gnu/bin
  and its contents, and you can't delete it.
* make clean from top level should not delete the BIN directories, it should
  just enter them (if they exist) and make clean.
