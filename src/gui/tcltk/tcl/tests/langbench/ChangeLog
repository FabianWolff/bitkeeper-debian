	- Make the grep expr be [^A-Za-z]fopen\(.*\) since that is not
	  trivially optimized.
	- Add fibonacci benchmark.
	- Make the procedure calls take more arguments.
	- add a findtclsh so that if you run this in a tcl source tree
	  under tests/langbench it just works.
	- Allow setting of each language with RUBY=/build/ruby/ruby
	  (for testing new versions like the ruby with a byte code
	  compiler).
