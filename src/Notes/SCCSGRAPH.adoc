SCCS, BK graph, with a light covering of symdiff
================================================

The SCCS graph

Each node has a serial number
-----------------------------
All serials are greater than 0, and sorted by age.
When two nodes are done in parallel, there is an algorithm
to assign strict ordering by age with tie breaker of sorting
their deltakeys.

NOTE: This means how we name deltas is wired into
to the structure of the graph, which gave rise to sortkeys.

Each node has a parent serial number
------------------------------------
Every node has 1 parent serial assigned to it.
For the root node, it has a parent of 0.

The parent link forms a tree graph -- no merges.

Many nodes may have the same parent serial number
-------------------------------------------------
N nodes may be based on the same parent node.
The reverse link of parent is kid for the oldest kid.
And a link list of x->sliblings for the rest of the kids:

d->kid, d->kid->siblings, d->kid->siblings->siblings, ...

Each node might have a merge serial number
------------------------------------------
NOTE: This is only in BK, and not AT&T SCCS.
A merge can bring together at most 2 nodes.
One of the nodes is a parent, the other is a merge.
To figure out which is which, walk the parent node of each
back to the greatest common ancestor, which will always exist.
Then see which kid from the GCA is oldest.  The node which
can reach the older kid is the parent node.  The other is the
merge node.  Looking at the graph with merge and parent edges,
it is a DAG.

Each node can be expanded to a set of nodes
-------------------------------------------
These are the nodes from a set point of view which make
up the version corresponding to the node.  If there are no
includes and excludes (covered next), then the set is
simply the transitive closure under the DAG.

Each node might have an exclude list
------------------------------------
If some node A wants to be excluded from the corresponding version of
a node B, then A can be added to the exclude list for B.
Note: the node A does not have to be in the corresponding version for
B to be excluded.

Each node might have an include list
------------------------------------
If some node A wants to be included from the corresponding version of
a node B, then A can be added to the include list for B.
Note: the node A does not have to be absent in the corresponding version for
B to be included.

AT&T and BK
-----------
BK has more constraints than AT&T SCCS when it comes to the graph.

AT&T does not have merge nodes.
BK does, but does not use them in corresponding version calculations,
instead relying solely on AT&T compatible encoding.

BK can have items in the include list that are already included,
or exclude list that are already excluded, but it can't have items
in either list that aren't in the DAG lattice of root to this node.

BK can't have items in both the include and exclude list at the same
time in a given node, nor can that node be in the include or exclude
list.  Given that, each node in an include and exclude list will be
older (smaller serial number) than the node.

Expansion of corresponding version
----------------------------------
This is a textual description of serialmap().

A data structure is used which has 3 bits associated with every node:
parent (`S_PAR`), include (`S_INC`), and exclude (`S_EXC`).  The data
structure is initialized with the parent bit set for the node being
expanded.

NOTE: the graph walk is in time sorted order of the nodes.  The parent
and merge edges are not used to determine the next node to visit.

There are two parts: a) state of this node (in or out of the
corresponding version set) and b) given the state of this node,
setting up older nodes.

a. State of this node: if marked included or (parent and not excluded),
then it is in the set.

b. Setting up other nodes: if this node marked parent, then mark
parent node as parent. If this node is in the corresponding version,
then process the include and exclude lists by walking the lists : for
each node A, if A's include and exclude bits aren't set, then set Aâ€™s
corresponding bit now (include or exclude).


Symmetric difference
--------------------
To take the symmetric difference of the corresponding version of two nodes,
left and right, make use of this property of the above expansion:
The state of the data structure at the start of processing for a node,
completely determines this node and all older nodes.

So if the two data structures for two nodes are the same, then the
symmetric difference between the two sets is the empty set.

Therefore, to terminate a symmetric difference without walking the whole
graph, track how many items are different, and when all the different
items have been visited, stop.

In graph_symdiff(), 'marked' stores how many serials in the data structure
are different for left and right.  When it hits zero, we are done.

To make optimal use of memory, 'lower' is used to clear out marking made
in the data structure that won't be needed.
