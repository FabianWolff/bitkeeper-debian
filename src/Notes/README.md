Development notes
=================

People who worked on BitKeeper over the years developed a habit of
writing down some notes about whatever it was they were working on
(assuming it was complex enough, or came up enough).
All of these live in `src/Notes`.

A copy of the docs for the 'dev' tree can be found
[online](http://www.bitkeeper.org/src-notes/).
