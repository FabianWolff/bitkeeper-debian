The structure of collapse command as an enhanced fix -c
=======================================================

bk collapse
	-aAFTERREV		# collapse all csets descended from AFTERREV
	-rLIST_OF_REVS	        # replace all csets named in LIST_OF_REVS
	-e			# leave open, don't run delta/commit
	-m			# collapse all csets into first merge on trunk
	-q 			# silent
	-s			# don't save backup patch
	-L			# don't log old keys

With no args we collapse the top cset.  (Without -e we error if no local edits
or pending deltas.)

Adds new file BitKeeper/etc/collapsed which contains all keys collapsed.
(unless -L)

-m is just a shorthand for generating the list to pass to -r

bk fix -c	-> bk collapse -r+ -e
bk fix -c -r1.9	-> bk collapse -a1.9 -e
bk collapse -r+ -e == bk collapse -e

bk pull
  .. do merge ..
make fixup
bk citool (optional)
bk collapse -m
bk comments -C+
