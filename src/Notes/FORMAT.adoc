Relating to FLAGS file, extensions to ATT SCCS for state capture
================================================================

My file format differs from the ATT SCCS file format in the following ways:

I have the following extra information in the file:

	Pathname
	RCS style tags
	hostname of the machine making the delta
	timezone of the delta 

I want file format compatibility with AT&T SCCS so here's how that happened.
Rochkind knew I was coming and he passes unknown flags through his SCCS 
parser.  So the new flags are

	...
    	^Af h <rev> hostname
	^Af P <rev> pathname
	^Af w <rev> minuteswest of GMT
    	^Af s <rev> symbol
    	^Af R
	...

The hostname/pathname/minuteswest "inherit".  What this means is that if
all the deltas were made in PST, then the only minuteswest entry would
look like

	^Af w 1.1 8:00

Binary encodings:
	
	^Af e 0			# means no encoding, just ascii
	^Af e 1			# traditional uuencoding
	^af e 2			# gzipped, uuencoded
