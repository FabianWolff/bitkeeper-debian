md5key:line-added-by-that-key - proposed and not used
=====================================================

The Absolute Naming of Each Line
--------------------------------

MD5delta + '.' + lineno-in-delta

Each line in the weave was contributed by some delta.
That delta may have been responsible for a number of lines.

Here's an annotated weave, with X:Y where X is the serial number,
and Y is the line number starting at 1 of lines in the originating
delta.

X:Y	Weave
--------------------------------------------
	^AI 1
1:1	#include <stdio.h>
1:2	main()
1:3	{
	^AD 2
1:4	printf("Hello World\n");
	^AE 2
	^AI 2
2:1	sub("Hello World\n");
	^AE 2
1:5	}
	^AI 2
2:2	
2:3	sub(char *s)
2:4	{
2:5		return (printf("%s", %s));
2:6	}
	^AE 2
	^AE 1
--------------------------------------------

The output for serial 2 looks like (with serial replaced by md5key):
1:1	#include <stdio.h>
1:2	main()
1:3	{
2:1	sub("Hello World\n");
1:5	}
2:2	
2:3	sub(char *s)
2:4	{
2:5		return (printf("%s", %s));
2:6	}

Interface
---------

Command line: bk get -O (the old sequence number interface)
Doesn't work with -a formatted.  Should it?

sccs_get() flags:
GET_LINENAME - defined as the last bit in the GET_* flags.
Question: do we want to use up the last bit for this?

Code
----
In getRegBody():
	make a mdbm namddb:
		(serial -> md5name) which is lazily filled by printing
	make lnum: s->nextserial size array of u32 that counts line numbers
		that could get big .. what are other options?
