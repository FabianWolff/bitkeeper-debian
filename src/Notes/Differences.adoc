Differences from the original SCCS
==================================

	. SCCS/s.file is the only supported sort of name.  Use
	  "ln -s SCCS ." if you want s.files with your source.
	
	. get /full/path/SCCS/s.foo puts the file in /full/path/foo
	  not ./foo.   I'm not sure if this is a problem, if it is 
	  it is easy to fix.  Need to see how this interacts w/ make
	  and viewpaths etc.
	
	. delta works like the RCS ci - if there are no differences
	  then the file is unedited instead of adding an empty delta.
	  Use "delta -f" to force a delta.

	. branch flag is unsupported at this time.

	. get supports a -R<rev> which forces the next rev to be whatever
	  you specify.  For testing only, use at your own risk.

	. new program, parent, gives you the parent of a particular 
	  delta.  Usage "parent <rev> filename".
