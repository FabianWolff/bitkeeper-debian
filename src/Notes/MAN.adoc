Info about man files
====================

Categories
    Each man page _may_ have a .SH CATEGORY <category> entry.  If it
    does, then an entry is added to the <category>.c command listing.
    Whether it does or does not have a .SH CATEGORY entry, an entry is
    added to the section listing (eg 1.c, 8.c, etc).  Each category
    may have a man page itself in the source tree, as <category>.c.
    If it does, then the autogenerated portion of the category man page
    is prefixed with the existing man page.
Namespaces
    A category man page is <category>.c and the category namespace must
    be unique.  The "Categories" and "Alphabetical" categories are reserved
    for system use; you must pick a different name.
    It's a requirement that the entire namespace is unique, when including
    the section name/number.
Helptool
    Inside helptool, we index things by <name>.<section> which explains the
    namespace requirement.
    It looks like this when you start up helptool on a bunch of man pages in
    sections 1, 5, 8 with some which had .SH CATEGORY Category1, Category2:
    Categories
      All
      Category1
      Category2
      1
      7
      8
    Alphabetical
      abort.1
      ...
      ...
      foo.1
      foo.8
      ...
      zebra.8
Autogeneration of information
    We generate a temporary listing of command synopsis in _<category>.c as
    we work through the list of files.  At the end, we sort these, add the
    roff commands to turn it into a listing, and create <category>.c, 
    either prepended with the man page <category>.c or we provide a default
    header (the standard BitMover .TH stuff).
    The complete list of autogenerated pages are
	All.c
	A.c
	B.c
	C.c	where A, B, C are .SH CATEGORY entries
	1.c
	8.c	where 1, 8 are man page suffices.
Lookups
    bk help/helptool will now take lookups of the form <name> or
    <name>.<section>.  If there is a foo.1 and a foo.8 and you say
    bk helptool foo, you get foo.1.  This has implications for the
    helptopiclist command.
