A little on BK/Web as well as what a free version would look like.
==================================================================

In order to get the sorting that Beth wants (and CVSweb does), we need to
wack sccslog.  There are two changes needed:

a. -r<rev>, this needs to be a range enabled rev.  In the BKweb case,
   we would always do -r+.

b. -s<sort field> where <sort field> is rev|user|date|filename

c. prs dspec usage for the printing of the results.  This one is a little
   more complicated, we need to save the sccs *s to make it work.  In order
   to not run out of memory, we need to sccs_close(s) to do the unmmaps.
   Then we need a way of going from delta to sccs* so we can pass that in.


== How free license handling works.


The idea is that a free bkweb can run if it's public;  to do that,
set up a license server at bitmover and have the bkd query it for
a license.

The flow of data is

-------------------------------------------------
browser			bkd		child			license server
1:   --- GET <blah> -->
2:		           --- (fork) -->
3:			   <-- MMI? ---
4:			   --- NO\0\0 -->
5:			   -------- GET a.license?server=<server> -->
6:			   <------- GET license?expires=<when> ------
7:			   --- (fork) -->
8:			   <-- S<when> ---
9:			   <-- MMI? ---
10:			   --- YES\0 -->
11: <------ contents of <blah> ---------

1: http: GET
2: bkd forks a child to handle the request
3: ipc:  4 bytes (MMI? = Mother May I ?)
4: ipc:  4 bytes 
3&4 repeat for 30 seconds, waiting up to 5 seconds between requests.
5: http: bkd forks a special child, which does a GET to the license server
6: http: license server connects back to the bkd, does a GET with the license
7: bkd forks a child to handle the request
8: ipc: 4 bytes (Sddd, where ddd is the number of minutes the license is valid)
9: ipc: 4 bytes (first child asks for permission)
10: ipc: 4 bytes (bkd permits it)
11: http: first child returns the requested page
