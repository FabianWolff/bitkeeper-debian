Basic locking model - not nested
================================

Reader/writer locking in BK.

This is single repository wide locking, not individual file locking.

Writer lock
-----------

Lock files are maintained in BitKeeper/writer.  Currently there
are two files hardlinked to each other:
	BitKeeper/writer/${pid}@${host}.lock (AKA - uniq)
	BitKeeper/writer/lock

Content:
	pid <space> host <space> time(0)

On unix, create uniq, then hard link to 'lock'.
On windows, use win32 api to create 'lock'.
Either way, should get some peace of mind that the lock has been grabbed.
See sccs_lockfile() for more.

Reader lock
-----------

Lock files are maintained in BitKeeper/readers.
There can be many files of the form:
	BitKeeper/readers/${pid}@${host}.lock (AKA - uniq)

RESYNC dir
----------

The RESYNC directory gets created by takepatch and by various operations
when hitting an error.  The RESYNC directory acts like a read lock,
blocking write operations, and allowing readlocks to be taken.

Locking stuff
-------------

When trying to get a writer lock, walk the reader list and kill 0 each
of them that are on the same host.  If they are all gone, then remove
them and let the lock succeed.

This means that the process who created the lock can't exit until all
of the child processes are done.

Places we need to lock:

	clone/rclone
	resolve (both its own, and in pass4, grabs a repo write lock)
	pull
	push
	undo
