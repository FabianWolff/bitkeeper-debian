A plan for handling files too big for an sfile
==============================================

The plan for arbitrarily large files
------------------------------------

This plan currently only handles the case that each delta is not stored
as diffs.  The diffs part is a refinement to come later.

Suppose the file is "foo", the sfile is "SCCS/s.foo".

If the file gets too large, then SCCS/s.foo becomes SCCS/d.foo, which is a
directory.  In that directory, you will find

	SCCS/d.foo/s.foo	- this is the delta table graph.
	SCCS/d.foo/#.foo	- serial number # contents
