Thoughts on revision number mapping when importing RCS / ATT SCCS
=================================================================

The only hard part about converting is getting the revision numbers 
correct.  Because of the differences in RCS/SCCS revision numbering,
there can't be a 1:1 mapping.

We punt in the following way:  sort the revisions by date and check them
in in that order.  That way, the revisions will probably be numbered the
same but may not be on bushy RCS files.

In order to convert, I need a rev/parent rev/date tuple.  I sort on date
and then check them in oldest to newest.

For RCS, I can get 2/3's of what I want from rlog; I have to parse the
RCS file to get the rest.

For SCCS, I can get the parent/child relationship from sids, and the rest
from prs.
