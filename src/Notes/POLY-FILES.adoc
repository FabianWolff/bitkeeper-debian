Some notes about file poly
==========================

File poly (ie, not component poly -- see Notes/POLY for components)

== Error cases:

commit - one key in the tip cset, one elsewhere

check in resync - one key in remote and the other key in local

commit in the resync - commit + check in resync conditions


== Non-error cases:

Complain about all duplicates of "rkey dkey" in the weave.

Non-error cases can be quieted by putting "dkey" in the etc/ignore-poly
file


== BitKeeper/etc/ignore-poly file

* converge code - does (in essence) a sort -u as part of the converge.
  (really, a merge -s, for set based (hash) merge)

* when reading from the RESYNC, read the resync dir first, then main repo
  Follow 'bk cat' rules for reading file.
